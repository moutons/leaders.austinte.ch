Welcome to our first blog post. It's a nerve-wracking thing, bringing a new conference into being.

There have been numerous discussions over the years wondering how we can build community around practicing DevOps at the managerial or senior individual contributor level. We've had it come up at local meetups, at DevOpsDays Austin, and in the various online forums we hang out in. It turns out that if you don't build it, it's incredibly likely they won't come - so here it is.

We're holding the first event on March 2nd of 2024 in Round Rock. Please join us for a day of framing plenary talks and Open Spaces, where we make the conference what we need it to be in the moment.
