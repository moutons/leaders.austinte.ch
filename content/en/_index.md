Join us on [Saturday, March 2nd 2024](https://tickets.austinte.ch/ats-01/) for an unconference by and for leaders in technology in the Austin area. This event brings together individual contributors working at the Staff+ level of responsibility, managers of technologists, and other folks working at a senior level in their organizations. We will have some short plenary talks to frame the day, and the rest of our time will be spent directly discussing the most pressing issues facing us today.
