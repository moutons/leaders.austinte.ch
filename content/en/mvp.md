Join us on March 2nd, 2024 in the Centro Event Space in downtown Round Rock!

We will have some short plenary talks to frame the day, and the rest of our time will be spent directly discussing the most pressing issues facing us today.

If you are a DevOpsDays Austin sponsor, please reach out to us directly at <support@austinte.ch> as we have some discounted tickets available.
