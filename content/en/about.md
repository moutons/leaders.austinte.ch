At austinte.ch we host community-focused events and resources for technologists in the Austin, TX area.

There is a Discourse instance at [Austin Tech](https://talk.austinte.ch) where we can hold long-form slow discussions about the things that are important to us as a community. For an invite, check the [#atxdevops channel header on HangOps Slack](https://signup.hangops.com/).
